## facial-expression-recognition

_In Short: This project aims recognize facial expressions in the **image or stream**._


### Abstract
We look at the effects of varying number of hidden layers and hidden units on the performance of the model and attempt to develop important insights into the features learnt by the model. 
This project is an attempt to look at the task of emotion recognition using deep belief networks which is cognitively very appealing and at the same has been shown to perform very well for digit recognition.
